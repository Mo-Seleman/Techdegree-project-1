        <p><em>Some informtion on places I have worked</em></p>
        <article>At my most recent professional job I worked as a Fraud Anaylyst for a bank based in the UK. My main role was to investigate suspicous activity and minimize financial loss. In my day to day role I would analyse accounts and contact customers over the phone.</article>

        <p>At this job I used a system called TS2</p>

        <article>This system took  time to learn. At a glance it can look very confusing, simular to codeing. Although after a few months I mastered the controls. This motivates me when learning to code.</article>
